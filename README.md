# System-Design-Patterns

## What are these?
1. System Design Patterns are solutions to commonly faced problems in Software Design.
2. They are kind of blueprints to solve recurring design problems in code.

## Benefits of Learning these
1. In Software Design, you can use these patterns to build scalable and maintainable systems.
2. It can help you in cracking interview rounds.
