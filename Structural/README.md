1. Structural design patterns in software engineering focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures
2. They deal with relationships between classes and objects, aiming to ensure that changes to one part of the system do not require changes to other parts. 

Honestly, I was not able to understand it so I copied the above point from ChatGPT. Even though I fully understand sub-patterns of this category.

## Types
1. [Adapter Design Pattern](./Adapter/)
2. [Facade Design Pattern](./Facade/)
3. ...coming soon
